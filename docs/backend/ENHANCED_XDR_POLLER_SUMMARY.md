# Enhanced XDR Security Data Polling Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The XDR poller has been successfully refactored to fetch comprehensive security data beyond basic alerts. The enhanced service now collects and processes a complete security context including assets, events, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and threat intelligence data, while maintaining backward compatibility and production-ready features.

## Enhanced Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Security Data Collection

#### **Assets Data Collection**
- Extracts asset information from alert relationships and included data
- Enriches asset data with criticality metadata and business impact assessment
- Supports multiple asset types (servers, workstations, network devices)
- Automatically infers asset information when only asset counts are available

#### **Security Events Data Collection**
- Fetches detailed event data associated with alerts
- Extracts IOCs and artifacts from event attributes
- Implements correlation confidence scoring
- Preserves event timeline and sequence information

#### **MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping**
- Automatically maps alerts to MITRE ATT&CK techniques based on rule patterns
- Analyzes alert content for technique indicators
- Assigns tactic priorities for risk assessment
- Supports 12 primary MITRE tactics (TA0001-TA0011, TA0040)

#### **Threat Intelligence Context**
- Extracts IOCs using pattern matching (IPs, domains, hashes)
- Correlates with threat intelligence availability flags
- Provides confidence scoring for intelligence data
- Supports multiple intelligence sources (TIP, Mandiant, Internal)

#### **IOC and Artifact Extraction**
- Comprehensive artifact extraction from multiple data sources
- Sanitization status tracking
- Event field analysis for additional IOCs
- Support for various IOC types (IP, domain, hash, email, URL)

### 2. Enhanced Alert Processing and Classification

#### **Automatic Security Classification**
- **CRITICAL**: Data exfiltration, C&C communication, multi-stage attacks
- **HIGH**: Privilege escalation, credential access, defense evasion
- **MEDIUM**: Reconnaissance activities, suspicious email patterns
- **LOW/INFORMATIONAL**: Low-severity alerts without correlation

#### **Composite Risk Scoring Algorithm**
```
Base Score = (severity × 2) + (confidence × 1.5) + (asset_count × 0.5) + (tactic_priority × 1.0)
Correlation Multiplier = 1.5x for correlated alerts
Final Score = min(Base Score × Multiplier, 25.0)
```

#### **Workflow Classification**
- **Auto-Containable**: Has assets and IOCs for automated response
- **Auto-Enrichable**: Intelligence available for automated enrichment
- **Manual-Required**: Complex scenarios requiring human analysis

#### **Response SLA Determination**
- **15-minute SLA**: Critical classification alerts
- **1-hour SLA**: High severity with asset impact
- **4-hour SLA**: Medium severity alerts
- **24-hour SLA**: Low priority alerts

### 3. Service Architecture Integration

#### **Decomposed Service Pattern**
- Integrates with `AlertProcessingService` for enhanced analysis
- Uses `ServiceCoordinator` for unified service access
- Maintains compatibility with existing configuration services
- Implements proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### **Graph Database Integration**
- Stores enhanced alert data in Neo4j with rich relationship modeling
- Creates correlation relationships between alerts, assets, and events
- Supports graph-based security analysis and attack chain identification
- Implements proper connection pooling and session management

#### **Dual Storage Strategy**
- **Enhanced JSON Files**: Complete security data with comprehensive metadata
- **Summary Files**: Quick reference with data collection statistics
- **Graph Database**: Relational data for correlation and analysis
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original JSON format preserved

### 4. Production-Ready Features

#### **Error Handling and Resilience**
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Fallback to basic mode if enhanced services fail
- Comprehensive error logging with context
- Maintains operation continuity under various failure scenarios

#### **Development and Testing Support**
- Development mode with dummy credential handling
- Comprehensive test suite with mock data
- Command-line options for different operational modes
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

#### **Configuration Flexibility**
- Enhanced field collection by default
- Basic mode override for simple deployments
- Configurable polling intervals and batch sizes
- Environment-specific settings support

- Intelligence flags: `isIntelAvailable`, `isCorrelated`, `isSilent`, `isSuppressed`
- Correlation data: `totalEventMatchCount`, `alertAggregationCount`, `lastAggregatedTime`
- Timeline data: `inTimeline`, `inPin`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Enhanced metadata: `genaiName`, `genaiSummary`, `ruleOrigin`
- Artifacts: `artefacts`, `primarySecondaryFields`
